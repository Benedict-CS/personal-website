0cff4b75-5639-4aef-91b0-517d1be3f907	HomeLab Infra: Building a Private Cloud from Proxmox to TrueNAS Scale	truenas-private-cloud	> **Introduction**\n>\n> In the world of software engineering, the classic question is **"Build vs. Buy."**\n>\n> When it comes to managing our digital lives—**storing terabytes of photos, documents, and videos**—we face this exact choice. Should we keep paying monthly fees for services like **Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud**? Or should we build our own solution?\n>\n> As a Computer Science Master's student, facing rising subscription costs on a limited budget, relying on SaaS wasn't sustainable. **In the true spirit of engineering, I decided not to pay for convenience, but to engineer my own freedom.**\n>\n> This project isn't just about saving money; it is a **HomeLab** designed to translate academic theories—virtualization, container orchestration, and storage management—into practical, production-grade experience. This post breaks down how I engineered a **TrueNAS Scale** based private cloud with **High Reliability**, **Tiered Storage**, and **DevOps** principles using consumer-grade hardware.\n\n## 1. Technical Decision: The Shift from Proxmox VE to TrueNAS Scale\n\nThis migration wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. **For over a year, I had architected and actively maintained a Proxmox VE environment as my daily driver.**\n\nHowever, my setup was fragmented, consisting of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) connected via a standard Linux Bridge.\n\n![Legacy Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769247011895-Demo_1.jpg)\n*(▲ Legacy Architecture: Direct IP exposure, manual configs, and high VM overhead.)*\n\nAs illustrated above, despite serving me for a year, this architecture had significant drawbacks:\n* **Security Risks**: No **WAF** protection; residential IP directly exposed via GoDaddy DNS.\n* **Management Overhead**: Manually maintaining `nginx.conf` and patching 4 separate Guest OS kernels.\n* **Resource Waste**: High CPU/RAM overhead from running multiple full-blown VMs instead of lightweight containers.\n\nI realized I needed a system that prioritized **Storage Stability** and **Efficiency**, leading to the migration to TrueNAS Scale.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hardware Architecture & Resource Provisioning\n\nTo handle mixed workloads—database I/O, large file storage, and concurrent container execution—I moved away from the "just enough" mentality and adopted a **Workstation-grade** configuration.\n\nCrucially, I implemented a strict **Tiered Storage Strategy**:\n\n| Component | Specification | Architectural Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CPU** | **i9-10900** | **10 Cores / 20 Threads**. High concurrency headroom for containers & DBs. |\n| **RAM** | **64GB DDR4** | **ZFS Optimization**. Maximizes RAM caching to minimize HDD read latency. |\n| **Boot Drive** | **NVMe SSD** | **OS Isolation**. Separates system logs/updates from App I/O. |\n| **App Drive** | **SATA SSD** | **High IOPS Tier**. Dedicated pool for random R/W (Docker/PostgreSQL). |\n| **Data Drive** | **4TB HDD x 2** | **Throughput Tier**. RAID 1 Mirror prioritization for cold storage safety. |\n\n![ZFS Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769159685591-messageImage_1769159064998.jpg)\n*(▲ ZFS Storage Architecture: Logical isolation of Boot, Apps, and Data pools.)*\n\n\n> **⚡ Power Efficiency Note:**\n> Despite utilizing a workstation-class **Intel Core i9**, the system maintains a remarkably low baseline power consumption of **28–31W**. This demonstrates that with proper power management, high-performance hardware can still be highly energy-efficient for 24/7 HomeLab operation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Network Topology & Microservices Orchestration\n\nThe core value of this private cloud lies in its ability to securely deliver multiple services to the public internet, effectively breaking free from expensive Big Tech ecosystems.\n\nTo secure these services, I transformed the network topology to a **"Single Entry Point, Reverse Proxy"** architecture.\n\n![Modern Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769247033822-Demo_2.jpg)\n*(▲ Modern Architecture: Secured flow via Cloudflare WAF -> NPM SSL -> Docker Containers.)*\n\n### Key Architectural Improvements\n\n1.  **Edge Security (Cloudflare)**:\n    * Acts as a shield (**WAF**). Masks residential IP and filters malicious traffic (DDoS/SQLi) at the edge.\n2.  **Gateway Layer (Nginx Proxy Manager)**:\n    * Replaces manual config files. **NPM** handles **SSL Termination** and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates.\n3.  **Container Efficiency**:\n    * Services run as lightweight Docker containers sharing host kernel, reduce resource overhead compared to VMs.\n\n### Microservices Stack\nI deployed a comprehensive stack to regain full digital sovereignty:\n* **Nextcloud**: Alternative to **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **iCloud**.\n* **OnlyOffice**: Alternative to **Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** and **Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)**.\n* **Immich**: Alternative to **Google Photos** and **iCloud Photos**.\n\n![TrueNAS Apps Dashboard](/api/media/serve/1769242382546-messageImage_1769242283290.jpg)\n*(▲ Production Dashboard: The container fleet running on TrueNAS Scale. )*\n\n> [📂 Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Live Demo](https://cloud-ben.winlab.tw/s/2c6EcP9F3H7ix5Q)\n>\n> [📂 Immich Live Demo](https://image-ben.winlab.tw/s/demo)\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis TrueNAS Scale infrastructure is more than just a storage server; it is a platform demonstrating **Full-Stack Infrastructure** capabilities.\n\nFrom hardware assembly and ZFS tuning to container orchestration and network security, every layer required deep system understanding. Through this HomeLab, I have been able to validate DevOps theories in a production-like environment, continuously refining my skills in System Administration and Architecture Design.\n\n**Future Roadmap:**\n* Implement **Prometheus + Grafana** for centralized metrics and alerting.\n* Transition manual configurations to **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management.	t	2026-01-20 00:00:00	2026-01-24 17:21:55.141	t	\N	0	Migrating from Proxmox to TrueNAS Scale, architecting a private cloud to replace Google Drive, One Drive and iCloud.

d1f2c896-dee9-44f7-94b0-d84845c8ebbc	Thesis: A CI/CD Framework for Zero Downtime Deployment in Wi-Fi Mesh Networks	thesis	I recently completed my Master's thesis, focusing on bringing modern DevOps practices to resource-constrained Wi-Fi Mesh networks. The goal was to solve a common pain point: software updates on routers usually mean network interruptions.\n\nIn this post, I’ll walk through the architecture and the technology stack I built to achieve **Zero Downtime Deployment** on embedded Wi-Fi Access Points (APs).\n\n### The Motivation: Why do this?\n\nTraditional software updates for Wi-Fi devices are typically "monolithic". This means to fix a small bug or add a feature, the entire firmware needs to be reflashed, followed by a device reboot. This process is slow and causes service interruptions.\n\nWith embedded systems like **prplOS** now supporting containerization, we can decouple applications into microservices. My thesis proposes a standardized CI/CD framework to automate these updates without killing the internet connection.\n\n### System Architecture\n\nI designed a **Hierarchical Management Architecture** tailored for the tree-like topology of Wi-Fi Mesh networks.\n\nInstead of the cloud managing every single node directly, I used a tiered approach:\n\n1.  **Cloud Control Plane:** Managing the entry point.\n2.  **Root AP (Orchestrator):** The Root AP receives commands and acts as a local controller, broadcasting instructions to Extender APs via the internal network.\n3.  **Edge Execution:** All nodes execute the deployment in parallel.\n\n![Figure: Comprehensive Architecture and Workflow](path/to/your/image_fig_4_1.png)\n*(Figure 4.1 from thesis)*\n\n### The Tech Stack\n\nTo make this work on devices with limited RAM and Flash storage (like the Qualcomm IPQ9570 used in my experiments), I had to carefully select lightweight technologies.\n\n#### 1. "Build with Docker, Run with LXC"\n\nWhile Docker is great for development, a full Docker Engine is often too heavy for an embedded AP.\n\n* **OS:** I used **prplOS** (based on OpenWrt).\n* **Runtime:** I adopted a hybrid strategy. I used **GitHub Actions** to build OCI-compliant images using Docker. However, on the AP itself, I used the lightweight **LXC (Linux Containers)** runtime to execute them.\n* **Efficiency:** My experiments showed that 50 concurrent container instances consumed only about 400-600MB of RAM total, with each instance taking ~8-11MB.\n\n#### 2. Standardized Management: USP (TR-369)\n\nTo avoid proprietary lock-in, I utilized the **User Services Platform (USP/TR-369)** standard by the Broadband Forum.\n\n* **Communication:** I used **STOMP over WebSocket** for the Cloud-to-Root communication. This allows the AP (behind NAT) to maintain a persistent connection to the cloud.\n* **Internal Signaling:** Inside the AP, I utilized Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for high-performance communication between the USP Agent and the deployment controller.\n\n![Figure: End-to-End Architecture](path/to/your/image_fig_4_2.png)\n*(Figure 4.2 from thesis)*\n\n#### 3. The Core Magic: Zero Downtime via iptables\n\nThis is the most critical part of the thesis. To eliminate the downtime that usually happens when restarting a container (Stop-then-Start), I implemented a **Seamless Traffic Steering** mechanism using the Linux Kernel's native **iptables**.\n\nThe process works like this:\n\n1.  **Parallel Execution:** The new version of the container (V2) is started in the background while V1 is still running.\n2.  **Shadow Chain:** The system pre-constructs a new iptables rule chain (a "Shadow Chain") in memory.\n3.  **Atomic Switch:** Once V2 is ready, I use a single atomic operation to switch the traffic flow to the new chain.\n\nThis results in **Zero Packet Loss** during the update.\n\n#### 4. Advanced Deployment Strategies\n\nBy utilizing the `statistic` module in iptables, I also implemented advanced deployment strategies:\n\n* **Blue-Green Deployment:** Instant cutover from 0% to 100% traffic.\n* **Canary Deployment:** Gradually shifting traffic (e.g., 10% -> 20% -> 100%) to the new version to minimize risk.\n\n![Figure: Sequence Diagram of Automated Deployment](path/to/your/image_fig_4_11.png)\n*(Figure 4.11 from thesis)*\n\n### Results\n\nThe evaluation results were very promising:\n\n* **Speed:** The entire End-to-End deployment takes less than **30 seconds** on average.\n* **Reliability:** Compared to a traditional restart which caused ~50-70ms of downtime and packet loss, my framework achieved **0ms downtime**.\n* **Efficiency:** The system proved to be lightweight enough for consumer-grade hardware, confirming the feasibility of running microservices on the edge.\n\nThis thesis demonstrates that we can bring carrier-grade reliability and modern DevOps agility to Wi-Fi Mesh networks without upgrading the hardware.	t	2026-01-09 00:00:00	2026-01-24 17:23:59.948	f	\N	0	Pending

Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)\n\n### Description\nGiven an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.\n\nYou may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\n\nYou can return the answer in any order.\n\n**Example 1**\n```\nInput: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n```\nInput: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6\nOutput: [1,2]\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n```\nInput: nums = [3,3], target = 6\nOutput: [0,1]\n```\n\n\n## 1. Brute Force Approach\n**Logic:** Check every possible pair of numbers using nested loops.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {\n                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\n                    return {i, j};\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return {};\n    }\n};\n```\nComplexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$\n    - Analysis: We have two nested loops. If input size is $n$, we perform roughly $n \\times n$ operations.\n- Space Complexity: $O(1)$\n    - No extra data structures used.\n\n\n## 2. Hash Map Approach (Optimal)\nLogic: Use a Hash Map (`std::unordered_map`) to store numbers we have seen (`<Number, Index>`). For each number `x`, we check if `target - x` exists in the map. If yes, we found the pair. If no, we add `x` to the map.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\n        // Key: number value, Value: index\n        unordered_map<int, int> umap;\n\n        // Loop runs N times -> O(N)\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            int complement = target - nums[i];\n\n            // Hash Map Lookup (count/find) takes O(1) on average\n            if (umap.count(complement) > 0) {\n                return {i, umap.at(complement)};\n            } else {\n                // Hash Map Insert takes O(1) on average\n                umap.insert({nums[i], i}); \n            }\n        }\n        return {};\n    }\n};\n```\nComplexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Calculation: The loop runs $n$ times. Inside the loop, hash map operations (`lookup` and `insert`) take constant time $O(1)$ on average.\n    - Total: $n \\times O(1) = O(n)$.\n- Space Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Why? In the worst case (no pair found until the end), the hash map will store all $n$ elements.\n- Trade-off: We use extra space ($O(n)$ memory) to reduce time from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.	f	2026-01-24 00:00:00	2026-01-24 17:25:56.963	f	Leetcode/HashMap	0

Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate)\n\n### Description\nGiven an integer array `nums`, return `true `if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false `if every element is distinct.\n\n**Example 1**\n```\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe element 1 occurs at the indices 0 and 3.\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n```\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,4]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nAll elements are distinct.\n```\n\n**Example 3**\n```\nInput: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]\nOutput: true\n```\n\n## 1. Hash Map Approach (Optimal)\n**Logic:** Use a Hash Map or Hash Set to track elements we have seen. If we encounter a number that is already in the map/set, return `true`.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {\n        // Use unordered_map to count frequencies\n        // Time: O(n), Space: O(n)\n        unordered_map<int, int> umap;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            // Increment count for the current number\n            umap[nums[i]]++;\n\n            // If count becomes greater than 1, it's a duplicate\n            if (umap[nums[i]] > 1) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nComplexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Why? We iterate through the array once. Hash map operations (`insert`, `access`) are $O(1)$ on average.\n- Space Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Why? In the worst case (no duplicates), we store all $n$ elements in the map.\n- Note: Using `unordered_set `is slightly more efficient in space since we don't need to store the count (Value), just the existence (Key).	f	2026-01-24 00:00:00	2026-01-24 17:26:17.029	f	Leetcode/HashMap	0

Should we keep paying monthly fees for services like **Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud**? Or should we build our own solution?\n>\n> As a Computer Science Master's student, facing rising subscription costs on a limited budget, relying on SaaS wasn't sustainable. **In the true spirit of engineering, I decided not to pay for convenience, but to engineer my own freedom.**\n>\n> This project isn't just about saving money; it is a **HomeLab** designed to translate academic theories—virtualization, container orchestration, and storage management—into practical, production-grade experience. This post breaks down how I engineered a **TrueNAS Scale** based private cloud with **High Reliability**, **Tiered Storage**, and **DevOps** principles using consumer-grade hardware.\n\n## 1. Technical Decision: The Shift from Proxmox VE to TrueNAS Scale\n\nIn the early stages of my infrastructure planning, I experimented with **Proxmox VE**. My initial setup was fragmented, consisting of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) connected via a standard Linux Bridge.\n\n![Legacy Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769170953536-log2.png)\n*(▲ Legacy Architecture: Direct IP exposure, manual configs, and high VM overhead.)*\n\nAs illustrated above, this architecture had significant drawbacks:\n* **Security Risks**: No **WAF** protection; residential IP directly exposed via GoDaddy DNS.\n* **Management Overhead**: Manually maintaining `nginx.conf` and patching 4 separate Guest OS kernels.\n* **Resource Waste**: High CPU/RAM overhead from running multiple full-blown VMs instead of lightweight containers.\n\nI realized I needed a system that prioritized **Storage Stability** and **Efficiency**, leading to the migration to TrueNAS Scale.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hardware Architecture & Resource Provisioning\n\nTo handle mixed workloads—database I/O, large file storage, and concurrent container execution—I moved away from the "just enough" mentality and adopted a **Workstation-grade** configuration.\n\nCrucially, I implemented a strict **Tiered Storage Strategy**:\n\n| Component | Specification | Architectural Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CPU** | **i9-10900** | **10 Cores / 20 Threads**. High concurrency headroom for containers & DBs. |\n| **RAM** | **64GB DDR4** | **ZFS Optimization**. Maximizes RAM caching to minimize HDD read latency. |\n| **Boot Drive** | **NVMe SSD** | **OS Isolation**. Separates system logs/updates from App I/O. |\n| **App Drive** | **SATA SSD** | **High IOPS Tier**. Dedicated pool for random R/W (Docker/PostgreSQL). |\n| **Data Drive** | **4TB HDD x 2** | **Throughput Tier**. RAID 1 Mirror prioritization for cold storage safety. |\n\n![ZFS Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769159685591-messageImage_1769159064998.jpg)\n*(▲ ZFS Storage Architecture: Logical isolation of Boot, Apps, and Data pools.)*\n\n---\n\n## 3. Network Topology & Microservices Orchestration\n\nThe core value of this private cloud lies in its ability to securely deliver multiple services to the public internet, effectively breaking free from expensive Big Tech ecosystems.\n\nTo secure these services, I transformed the network topology to a **"Single Entry Point, Reverse Proxy"** architecture.\n\n![Modern Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769163826011-blog.png)\n*(▲ Modern Architecture: Secured flow via Cloudflare WAF -> NPM SSL -> Docker Containers.)*\n\n### Key Architectural Improvements\n\n1.  **Edge Security (Cloudflare)**:\n    * Acts as a shield (**WAF**). Masks residential IP and filters malicious traffic (DDoS/SQLi) at the edge.\n2.  **Gateway Layer (Nginx Proxy Manager)**:\n    * Replaces manual config files. **NPM** handles **SSL Termination** and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates.\n3.  **Container Efficiency**:\n    * Services run as lightweight Docker containers sharing the host kernel, slashing resource overhead compared to legacy VMs.\n\n### Microservices Stack\nI deployed a comprehensive stack to regain full digital sovereignty:\n* **Nextcloud**: Alternative to **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **iCloud**.\n* **OnlyOffice**: Alternative to **Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** and **Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)**.\n* **Immich**: Alternative to **Google Photos** and **iCloud Photos**.\n\n> [📂 Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Live Demo](https://cloud-ben.winlab.tw/s/2c6EcP9F3H7ix5Q)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis TrueNAS Scale infrastructure is more than just a storage server; it is a platform demonstrating **Full-Stack Infrastructure** capabilities.\n\nFrom hardware assembly and ZFS tuning to container orchestration and network security, every layer required deep system understanding.

Hardware Architecture & Resource Provisioning\n\nTo handle mixed workloads—database I/O, large file storage, and concurrent container execution—I moved away from the "just enough" mentality and adopted a **Workstation-grade** configuration.\n\nCrucially, I implemented a strict **Tiered Storage Strategy**:\n\n| Component | Specification | Architectural Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CPU** | **i9-10900** | **10 Cores / 20 Threads**. High concurrency headroom for containers & DBs. |\n| **RAM** | **64GB DDR4** | **ZFS Optimization**. Maximizes RAM caching to minimize HDD read latency. |\n| **Boot Drive** | **NVMe SSD** | **OS Isolation**. Separates system logs/updates from App I/O. |\n| **App Drive** | **SATA SSD** | **High IOPS Tier**. Dedicated pool for random R/W (Docker/PostgreSQL). |\n| **Data Drive** | **4TB HDD x 2** | **Throughput Tier**.

Network Topology & Microservices Orchestration\n\nThe core value of this private cloud lies in its ability to securely deliver multiple services to the public internet, effectively breaking free from expensive Big Tech ecosystems.\n\nTo secure these services, I transformed the network topology to a **"Single Entry Point, Reverse Proxy"** architecture.\n\n![Modern Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769163826011-blog.png)\n*(▲ Modern Architecture: Secured flow via Cloudflare WAF -> NPM SSL -> Docker Containers.)*\n\n### Key Architectural Improvements\n\n1.  **Edge Security (Cloudflare)**:\n    * Acts as a shield (**WAF**). Masks residential IP and filters malicious traffic (DDoS/SQLi) at the edge.\n2.  **Gateway Layer (Nginx Proxy Manager)**:\n    * Replaces manual config files. **NPM** handles **SSL Termination** and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates.\n3.  **Container Efficiency**:\n    * Services run as lightweight Docker containers sharing the host kernel, slashing resource overhead compared to legacy VMs.\n\n### Microservices Stack\nI deployed a comprehensive stack to regain full digital sovereignty:\n* **Nextcloud**: Alternative to **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **iCloud**.\n* **OnlyOffice**: Alternative to **Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** and **Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)**.\n* **Immich**: Alternative to **Google Photos** and **iCloud Photos**.\n\n> [📂 Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Live Demo](https://cloud-ben.winlab.tw/s/2c6EcP9F3H7ix5Q)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis TrueNAS Scale infrastructure is more than just a storage server; it is a platform demonstrating **Full-Stack Infrastructure** capabilities.\n\nFrom hardware assembly and ZFS tuning to container orchestration and network security, every layer required deep system understanding. Through this HomeLab, I have been able to validate DevOps theories in a production-like environment, continuously refining my skills in System Administration and Architecture Design.\n\n**Future Roadmap:**\n* Implement **Prometheus + Grafana** for centralized metrics and alerting.\n* Transition manual configurations to **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management.	t	["Docker","HomeLab","Next Cloud","Nginx","Private Cloud","TrueNAS","Virtualization","ZFS"]	2026-01-23 15:19:42.298	4

64132da4-ef45-4349-86b7-fe4bccde0d56	72597140-e1a3-4b22-afe8-3da2d2969ccd	個人網站架構演進：從 Stateless 到 RustFS 的心路歷程	stateless-rustfs	# 個人網站架構演進：從 Stateless 到 RustFS 的心路歷程\n\n> 記錄個人網站從無狀態設計到使用物件儲存，歷經 MinIO、SeaweedFS，最終選擇 RustFS 的完整過程\n\n## 起點：Stateless 設計的挑戰\n\n### 最初的架構\n\n一開始，我的個人網站採用「stateless」設計理念：\n- 所有資料都儲存在資料庫中\n- 圖片直接嵌入在文章內容中（base64 或直接 URL）\n- 沒有獨立的媒體儲存系統\n\n### 遇到的問題\n\n1. **資料庫膨脹**：圖片以 base64 編碼儲存在資料庫，導致資料庫檔案快速增長\n2. **效能問題**：每次載入文章都要從資料庫讀取大量圖片資料\n3. **維護困難**：無法獨立管理媒體檔案\n4. **擴展性差**：無法有效處理大量圖片\n\n## 第一次演進：引入 MinIO\n\n### 為什麼選擇 MinIO？\n\n在 2024 年，MinIO 是最受歡迎的開源 S3-compatible 物件儲存解決方案：\n- ✅ 完整的 S3 API 相容性\n- ✅ 簡單的 Docker 部署\n- ✅ 活躍的開發社群\n- ✅ 豐富的文件\n\n### 架構改變\n\n```\nBefore (Stateless):\nUser → Next.js → PostgreSQL (包含圖片 base64)\n\nAfter (MinIO):\nUser → Next.js → PostgreSQL (文章) + MinIO (圖片)\n```\n\n### 實作過程\n\n1. **加入 MinIO 服務**：\n   ```yaml\n   minio:\n     image: minio/minio:latest\n     ports:\n       - "9000:9000"\n   ```\n\n2. **使用 AWS S3 SDK**：\n   - 使用 `@aws-sdk/client-s3` 作為通用介面\n   - 這樣設計的好處是未來可以輕鬆切換到其他 S3-compatible 服務\n\n3. **建立上傳 API**：\n   - `/api/upload` - 處理圖片上傳\n   - `/api/media/serve/[filename]` - 提供圖片服務\n\n### 解決的問題\n\n- ✅ 資料庫大小大幅減少\n- ✅ 圖片載入效能提升\n- ✅ 可以獨立管理媒體檔案\n- ✅ 支援圖片清理功能\n\n## 轉折點：MinIO 進入維護模式\n\n### 2025年12月的消息\n\nMinIO 官方宣布進入維護模式：\n- ⚠️ 不再開發新功能\n- ⚠️ 只修復關鍵安全問題\n- ⚠️ 不再發布新的 Docker 映像\n\n### 我的考量\n\n作為個人專案，我面臨選擇：\n1. **繼續使用 MinIO**：目前穩定，但長期有風險\n2. **遷移到替代方案**：需要時間，但更符合長期規劃\n\n### 第一次嘗試：SeaweedFS\n\n經過評估，我首先嘗試了 **SeaweedFS**：\n\n**優點**：\n- ✅ Apache 2.0 授權（比 MinIO 的 AGPLv3 更寬鬆）\n- ✅ 分散式架構，可擴展性強\n- ✅ 活躍的開發社群（GitHub 20k+ stars）\n- ✅ 完整的 S3 API 相容性\n\n**遇到的問題**：\n- ❌ 需要多個服務（master, volume, filer, s3）- 複雜度高\n- ❌ 磁碟空間要求嚴格（至少 1% 可用空間）\n- ❌ 遷移困難（需要遷移多個服務的數據）\n- ❌ 在資源受限的環境下運行困難\n\n## 第二次演進：嘗試 SeaweedFS（但遇到問題）\n\n### 遷移過程\n\n### SeaweedFS 的挑戰\n\n雖然 SeaweedFS 功能強大，但在實際部署中遇到了問題：\n\n1. **複雜的架構**：需要 4 個服務協同工作\n2. **磁碟空間限制**：系統要求至少 1% 可用空間，但在資源受限的環境中難以滿足\n3. **遷移困難**：需要遷移 master、volume、filer 等多個服務的數據\n\n這些問題讓我重新思考：對於個人網站，是否真的需要如此複雜的分散式架構？\n\n## 第三次演進：選擇 RustFS\n\n### 為什麼最終選擇 RustFS？\n\n在嘗試 SeaweedFS 後，我發現了 **RustFS**：\n\n**RustFS 的優勢**：\n- ✅ **2.3x 比 MinIO 更快**（4KB 對象測試）\n- ✅ **Apache 2.0 授權**（商業友好，無 AGPL 限制）\n- ✅ **單一服務**（比 SeaweedFS 簡單得多）\n- ✅ **100% S3 兼容**（無縫遷移）\n- ✅ **內存安全**（Rust 編寫）\n- ✅ **強大的 Console**（比 MinIO 更好的管理界面）\n- ✅ **活躍開發**（GitHub 20k+ stars，持續更新）\n\n**遷移到 RustFS**：\n\n```yaml\n# 簡單的單一服務配置\nrustfs:\n  image: rustfs/rustfs:latest\n  ports:\n    - "9000:9000"  # S3 API\n    - "9001:9001"  # Console\n  volumes:\n    - ./rustfs-data:/data\n    - ./rustfs-logs:/logs\n```\n\n### 關鍵設計決策\n\n**使用標準 S3 API 的優勢**：\n\n從一開始就使用 AWS S3 SDK 的設計決策，讓所有遷移都變得非常簡單：\n- ✅ **不需要修改任何程式碼**：`src/lib/s3.ts` 只需要更新 endpoint 和註釋\n- ✅ **只需要更新配置**：修改 `docker-compose.yml` 和環境變數\n- ✅ **資料遷移簡單**：使用標準工具（rclone）即可\n\n這證明了**抽象層設計的重要性**。\n\n## 學到的經驗\n\n### 1. 抽象層設計的重要性\n\n使用標準 S3 API 而非 MinIO 專屬 API，讓遷移成本降到最低。\n\n### 2. 關注開源專案的長期維護\n\nMinIO 進入維護模式提醒我們：\n- 定期關注依賴專案的狀態\n- 評估授權條款的影響\n- 準備替代方案\n\n### 3. 文檔的重要性\n\n完整的文檔讓遷移過程變得順暢：\n- 記錄每個決策的原因\n- 記錄遷移步驟\n- 記錄遇到的問題和解決方案\n\n## 現在的架構\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐\n│   Web Browser   │\n└────────┬────────┘\n         │\n         ↓\n┌─────────────────┐\n│  Next.js App    │\n│  (Port 3000)    │\n└──────┬──────────┘\n       │\n   ┌───┴──────────────┐\n   ↓                   ↓\n┌──────┐    ┌──────────────────┐\n│Postgres│   │     RustFS       │\n│ :5432  │   │  :9000 (S3 API)  │\n└──────┘    │  :9001 (Console) │\n            └──────────────────┘\n```\n\n## 演進總結\n\n### Stateless → MinIO → SeaweedFS → RustFS\n\n1. **Stateless**：簡單但不可擴展\n2. **MinIO**：穩定但進入維護模式\n3. **SeaweedFS**：功能強大但過於複雜\n4. **RustFS**：簡單、快速、現代 ✅\n\n### 學到的經驗\n\n1. **抽象層設計的重要性**：使用標準 S3 API 讓遷移成本降到最低\n2. **簡單性優先**：對於個人網站，簡單的單一服務比複雜的分散式架構更合適\n3. **關注開源專案的長期維護**：定期評估依賴專案的狀態\n4. **效能很重要**：RustFS 的 2.3x 效能提升是實質的優勢\n5. **授權條款很重要**：Apache 2.0 比 AGPLv3 更適合商業使用\n\n## 未來規劃\n\n1. **監控 RustFS 的發展**：確保它持續活躍\n2. **優化效能**：根據實際使用情況調整配置\n3. **探索分散式部署**：如果未來需要，RustFS 也支援多節點\n4. **定期備份**：確保數據安全\n\n## 結論\n\n從 stateless 到 MinIO，再到 SeaweedFS，最終選擇 RustFS，這個過程讓我學到：\n- 架構設計要考慮未來變化\n- 使用標準介面（S3 API）的重要性\n- **簡單性往往比複雜性更好**\n- 開源專案的長期維護需要關注\n- 完整的文檔是無價的\n\n**關鍵啟示**：\n1. 好的抽象層設計，讓技術棧的切換變得簡單\n2. 對於個人專案，簡單的解決方案通常是最佳選擇\n3. 效能和授權條款同樣重要\n\n---\n\n*最後更新：2025年1月*	t	["Postgres","RustFS"]	2026-01-23 15:50:58.346	3

Hardware Architecture & Resource Provisioning\n\nTo handle mixed workloads—database I/O, large file storage, and concurrent container execution—I moved away from the "just enough" mentality and adopted a **Workstation-grade** configuration.\n\nCrucially, I implemented a strict **Tiered Storage Strategy**:\n\n| Component | Specification | Architectural Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CPU** | **i9-10900** | **10 Cores / 20 Threads**. High concurrency headroom for containers & DBs. |\n| **RAM** | **64GB DDR4** | **ZFS Optimization**. Maximizes RAM caching to minimize HDD read latency. |\n| **Boot Drive** | **NVMe SSD** | **OS Isolation**. Separates system logs/updates from App I/O. |\n| **App Drive** | **SATA SSD** | **High IOPS Tier**. Dedicated pool for random R/W (Docker/PostgreSQL). |\n| **Data Drive** | **4TB HDD x 2** | **Throughput Tier**. RAID 1 Mirror prioritization for cold storage safety. |\n\n![ZFS Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769159685591-messageImage_1769159064998.jpg)\n*(▲ ZFS Storage Architecture: Logical isolation of Boot, Apps, and Data pools.)*\n\n\n> **⚡ Power Efficiency Note:**\n> Despite utilizing a workstation-class **Intel Core i9**, the system maintains a remarkably low baseline power consumption of **31–33W**. This demonstrates that with proper power management, high-performance hardware can still be highly energy-efficient for 24/7 HomeLab operation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Network Topology & Microservices Orchestration\n\nThe core value of this private cloud lies in its ability to securely deliver multiple services to the public internet, effectively breaking free from expensive Big Tech ecosystems.\n\nTo secure these services, I transformed the network topology to a **"Single Entry Point, Reverse Proxy"** architecture.\n\n![Modern Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769163826011-blog.png)\n*(▲ Modern Architecture: Secured flow via Cloudflare WAF -> NPM SSL -> Docker Containers.)*\n\n### Key Architectural Improvements\n\n1.  **Edge Security (Cloudflare)**:\n    * Acts as a shield (**WAF**). Masks residential IP and filters malicious traffic (DDoS/SQLi) at the edge.\n2.  **Gateway Layer (Nginx Proxy Manager)**:\n    * Replaces manual config files. **NPM** handles **SSL Termination** and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates.\n3.  **Container Efficiency**:\n    * Services run as lightweight Docker containers sharing host kernel, reduce resource overhead compared to VMs.\n\n### Microservices Stack\nI deployed a comprehensive stack to regain full digital sovereignty:\n* **Nextcloud**: Alternative to **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **iCloud**.\n* **OnlyOffice**: Alternative to **Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** and **Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)**.\n* **Immich**: Alternative to **Google Photos** and **iCloud Photos**.\n\n> [📂 Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Live Demo](https://cloud-ben.winlab.tw/s/2c6EcP9F3H7ix5Q)\n\n> [📂 Immich Live Demo](https://image-ben.winlab.tw/s/demo-test)\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis TrueNAS Scale infrastructure is more than just a storage server; it is a platform demonstrating **Full-Stack Infrastructure** capabilities.\n\nFrom hardware assembly and ZFS tuning to container orchestration and network security, every layer required deep system understanding. Through this HomeLab, I have been able to validate DevOps theories in a production-like environment, continuously refining my skills in System Administration and Architecture Design.\n\n**Future Roadmap:**\n* Implement **Prometheus + Grafana** for centralized metrics and alerting.\n* Transition manual configurations to **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management.	t	["DevOps","HomeLab","Infra","Nextcloud","Private Cloud","Proxmox","System Design","TrueNAS"]	2026-01-24 08:07:17.036	17

Or should we build our own solution?\n>\n> As a Computer Science Master's student, facing rising subscription costs on a limited budget, relying on SaaS wasn't sustainable. **In the true spirit of engineering, I decided not to pay for convenience, but to engineer my own freedom.**\n>\n> This project isn't just about saving money; it is a **HomeLab** designed to translate academic theories—virtualization, container orchestration, and storage management—into practical, production-grade experience. This post breaks down how I engineered a **TrueNAS Scale** based private cloud with **High Reliability**, **Tiered Storage**, and **DevOps** principles using consumer-grade hardware.\n\n## 1. Technical Decision: The Shift from Proxmox VE to TrueNAS Scale\n\nThis migration wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. **For over a year, I had architected and actively maintained a Proxmox VE environment as my daily driver.**\n\nHowever, my setup was fragmented, consisting of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) connected via a standard Linux Bridge.\n\n![Legacy Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769247011895-Demo_1.jpg)\n*(▲ Legacy Architecture: Direct IP exposure, manual configs, and high VM overhead.)*\n\nAs illustrated above, despite serving me for a year, this architecture had significant drawbacks:\n* **Security Risks**: No **WAF** protection; residential IP directly exposed via GoDaddy DNS.\n* **Management Overhead**: Manually maintaining `nginx.conf` and patching 4 separate Guest OS kernels.\n* **Resource Waste**: High CPU/RAM overhead from running multiple full-blown VMs instead of lightweight containers.\n\nI realized I needed a system that prioritized **Storage Stability** and **Efficiency**, leading to the migration to TrueNAS Scale.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hardware Architecture & Resource Provisioning\n\nTo handle mixed workloads—database I/O, large file storage, and concurrent container execution—I moved away from the "just enough" mentality and adopted a **Workstation-grade** configuration.\n\nCrucially, I implemented a strict **Tiered Storage Strategy**:\n\n| Component | Specification | Architectural Reasoning |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **CPU** | **i9-10900** | **10 Cores / 20 Threads**. High concurrency headroom for containers & DBs. |\n| **RAM** | **64GB DDR4** | **ZFS Optimization**. Maximizes RAM caching to minimize HDD read latency. |\n| **Boot Drive** | **NVMe SSD** | **OS Isolation**. Separates system logs/updates from App I/O. |\n| **App Drive** | **SATA SSD** | **High IOPS Tier**. Dedicated pool for random R/W (Docker/PostgreSQL). |\n| **Data Drive** | **4TB HDD x 2** | **Throughput Tier**. RAID 1 Mirror prioritization for cold storage safety. |\n\n![ZFS Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769159685591-messageImage_1769159064998.jpg)\n*(▲ ZFS Storage Architecture: Logical isolation of Boot, Apps, and Data pools.)*\n\n\n> **⚡ Power Efficiency Note:**\n> Despite utilizing a workstation-class **Intel Core i9**, the system maintains a remarkably low baseline power consumption of **31–33W**. This demonstrates that with proper power management, high-performance hardware can still be highly energy-efficient for 24/7 HomeLab operation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Network Topology & Microservices Orchestration\n\nThe core value of this private cloud lies in its ability to securely deliver multiple services to the public internet, effectively breaking free from expensive Big Tech ecosystems.\n\nTo secure these services, I transformed the network topology to a **"Single Entry Point, Reverse Proxy"** architecture.\n\n![Modern Architecture](/api/media/serve/1769247033822-Demo_2.jpg)\n*(▲ Modern Architecture: Secured flow via Cloudflare WAF -> NPM SSL -> Docker Containers.)*\n\n### Key Architectural Improvements\n\n1.  **Edge Security (Cloudflare)**:\n    * Acts as a shield (**WAF**). Masks residential IP and filters malicious traffic (DDoS/SQLi) at the edge.\n2.  **Gateway Layer (Nginx Proxy Manager)**:\n    * Replaces manual config files. **NPM** handles **SSL Termination** and auto-renews Let's Encrypt certificates.\n3.  **Container Efficiency**:\n    * Services run as lightweight Docker containers sharing host kernel, reduce resource overhead compared to VMs.\n\n### Microservices Stack\nI deployed a comprehensive stack to regain full digital sovereignty:\n* **Nextcloud**: Alternative to **Google Drive**, **OneDrive**, and **iCloud**.\n* **OnlyOffice**: Alternative to **Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides)** and **Microsoft 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)**.\n* **Immich**: Alternative to **Google Photos** and **iCloud Photos**.\n\n![TrueNAS Apps Dashboard](/api/media/serve/1769242382546-messageImage_1769242283290.jpg)\n*(▲ Production Dashboard: The container fleet running on TrueNAS Scale. )*\n\n> [📂 Nextcloud and OnlyOffice Live Demo](https://cloud-ben.winlab.tw/s/2c6EcP9F3H7ix5Q)\n>\n> [📂 Immich Live Demo](https://image-ben.winlab.tw/s/demo)\n\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis TrueNAS Scale infrastructure is more than just a storage server; it is a platform demonstrating **Full-Stack Infrastructure** capabilities.\n\nFrom hardware assembly and ZFS tuning to container orchestration and network security, every layer required deep system understanding. Through this HomeLab, I have been able to validate DevOps theories in a production-like environment, continuously refining my skills in System Administration and Architecture Design.\n\n**Future Roadmap:**\n* Implement **Prometheus + Grafana** for centralized metrics and alerting.\n* Transition manual configurations to **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) management.	t	["DevOps","HomeLab","Infra","Nextcloud","Private Cloud","Proxmox","System Design","TrueNAS"]	2026-01-24 09:42:32.007	22

Brute Force Approach\n**Logic:** Check every possible pair of numbers using nested loops.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {\n                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\n                    return {i, j};\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return {};\n    }\n};\n```\n\n- Time Complexity: $O(n^2)$\n    - Analysis: We have two nested loops. If input size is $n$, we perform roughly $n \\times n$ operations.\n- Space Complexity: $O(1)$\n    - No extra data structures used.\n\n\n## 2. Hash Map Approach (Optimal)\nLogic: Use a Hash Map (`std::unordered_map`) to store numbers we have seen (`<Number, Index>`). For each number `x`, we check if `target - x` exists in the map. If yes, we found the pair. If no, we add `x` to the map.\n\n```\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {\n        // Key: number value, Value: index\n        unordered_map<int, int> umap;\n\n        // Loop runs N times -> O(N)\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {\n            int complement = target - nums[i];\n\n            // Hash Map Lookup (count/find) takes O(1) on average\n            if (umap.count(complement) > 0) {\n                return {i, umap.at(complement)};\n            } else {\n                // Hash Map Insert takes O(1) on average\n                umap.insert({nums[i], i}); \n            }\n        }\n        return {};\n    }\n};\n```\n\n- Time Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Calculation: The loop runs $n$ times. Inside the loop, hash map operations (`lookup` and `insert`) take constant time $O(1)$ on average.\n    - Total: $n \\times O(1) = O(n)$.\n- Space Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - Why? In the worst case (no pair found until the end), the hash map will store all $n$ elements.\n- Trade-off: We use extra space ($O(n)$ memory) to reduce time from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$.	f	["Leetcode"]	2026-01-24 15:04:11.264	13

Hash Map Approach (Optimal)\nIf the input constraints were removed (e.g., containing symbols, uppercase letters), `unordered_map` becomes the most intuitive and robust solution.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {\n        if (s.size() != t.size())\n            return false;\n\n        unordered_map<char, int> umap;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {\n            umap[s[i]]++;\n        }\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < t.size(); j++) {\n            umap[t[j]]--;\n            \n            if (umap[t[j]] < 0) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nComplexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - We iterate through the string once.\n- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ / $O(k)$\n    - For English letters, map size is max 26 ($O(1)$).\n    - For general Unicode, size is proportional to unique characters ($O(k)$).	f	["Leetcode"]	2026-01-24 17:02:48.426	2

Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram)\n\n### Description\nGiven two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an `anagram` of `s`, and `false` otherwise.\n\n**Example 1**\n```\nInput: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"\nOutput: true\n```\n\n**Example 2**\n```\nInput: s = "rat", t = "car"\nOutput: false\n```\n\n## 1. Hash Map Approach (Optimal)\nIf the input constraints were removed (e.g., containing symbols, uppercase letters), `unordered_map` becomes the most intuitive and robust solution.\n\n```cpp\nclass Solution {\npublic:\n    bool isAnagram(string s, string t) {\n        if (s.size() != t.size())\n            return false;\n\n        unordered_map<char, int> umap;\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {\n            umap[s[i]]++;\n        }\n\n        for (int j = 0; j < t.size(); j++) {\n            umap[t[j]]--;\n            \n            if (umap[t[j]] < 0) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return true;\n    }\n};\n```\n\nComplexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: $O(n)$\n    - We iterate through the string once.\n- Space Complexity: $O(1)$ / $O(k)$\n    - For English letters, map size is max 26 ($O(1)$).\n    - For general Unicode, size is proportional to unique characters ($O(k)$).	f	[]	2026-01-24 17:03:03.97	3
